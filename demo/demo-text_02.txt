======================

in terms of structure:
on the lower level, there is the structure of language - up to sentence.
on top of that, there could be, for example, something similar to what's used in science:
proposition, corollary, examples..

or, another could be:
thought (idea, concept); examples of the thought (some situations in which it applies, ...)

=====================
the {{}} and [[]] are sort of like different orders of magnitude
nesting also affects that criterion (of the order of magnitude)
there could also be weights <0> , <0.1>, ...
