This is part of a personal project I'm currently working on. It saves a tree-structured data to a Mongo database. It uses the official MongoDb Node.js driver and express. The core business logic is very rough - it's a rough sketch.

The `crud-tree.js` and `crud-tree-lib.js` is the core, which `api.js` uses directly. The `main.js` hooks everything up.
